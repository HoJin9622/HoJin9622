# Hi, I'm HoJin 👋

**Frontend Engineer** at Kakao Mobility, building webview services that handle large-scale traffic.

I focus on solving system-level problems beyond feature implementation — from runtime stability in MSA environments to Docker image optimization (82.8% size reduction). I enjoy turning recurring pain points into reusable SDKs and tools that make the whole team faster.

## What I'm Working On

- 🔧 Building internal SDKs and build plugins (Webpack/Rollup/Next.js) for zero-downtime K8s deployments
- 🛡️ Designing runtime validation layers with Zod to catch API contract mismatches before they crash
- ✍️ Writing about frontend engineering at [hojinlee.dev](https://www.hojinlee.dev)

## Highlights

- **Docker Image 82.8% Reduction** — Redesigned build pipeline with Next.js Standalone + Multi-stage Build + CDN offloading. Cut build time by 44% and deploy time by 19%.
- **Zero-downtime K8s Deploys** — Built Webpack/Rollup/Next.js plugins that auto-upload assets to CDN, eliminating 404 errors during rolling updates.
- **Runtime API Validation** — Introduced Zod-based response validation across MSA services, catching type mismatches gracefully with Sentry alerts instead of app crashes.
- **Internal CDN SDK** — Developed a Node.js SDK wrapping internal APIs, with full E2E tests and VitePress documentation.
